# minecraft-launcher

This minecraft launcher is a independent launcher that supports custom usernames. This allows you to play non-authenticating multiplayer servers where you can't connect to mojang's authentication servers.

Ideal for offline playing and in restrictive environments.

Additionally, this server only downloads libraries and game assets from a private server, instead of Mojang's. This means that anyone scanning network traffic may not be able to recognize normal minecraft traffic.

Allows for *stealthy*, *fast*, and *unlimited fun*. This launcher should work at *school*!
