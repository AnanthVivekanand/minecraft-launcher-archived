### Fast, stealthy, and free

This minecraft launcher is a independent launcher that supports custom usernames. This allows you to play even when you can't reach mojang's authentication servers.

Ideal for offline playing and in restrictive environments.

Additionally, this server only downloads libraries and game assets from a private server, instead of Mojang's. This means that anyone scanning network traffic *may not be able to recognize normal minecraft traffic*.

Allows for *stealthy*, *fast*, and *unlimited fun*. This launcher should work at *school*!
